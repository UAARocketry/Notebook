Length: ~15-20 minutes

#### [Slide 1: Introduction]

> Speaker: “Hi everyone! Welcome back to our second mini talk. Today, we’re diving into the science and engineering that goes into building rockets. Designing a rocket that can fly thousands of feet, carry a payload, and come back down safely is no small feat. Every successful launch requires a careful balance of power, stability, and safety.”

> Speaker Tip: Add a personal note or fun fact about rocket design to make it relatable. For example, share an anecdote about a design challenge the club faced and how the team solved it.

#### [Slide 2: The Three Key Elements of Rocket Design]

> Speaker: “When it comes to designing rockets, we focus on three core elements: Power, Stability, and Safety. These three principles are our guiding stars throughout the entire design and build process. Let’s take a look at each one.”

1. Power: 
   - “First, we have Power. Power in rocketry means selecting the right motor for our goals. Motors come in different classes, from smaller ones used in hobby rockets to powerful motors like M or N-class that are used for high-altitude flights.”
   - “The motor class determines how high and fast a rocket can fly. In high-power rocketry, we’re usually working with H, J, and even M motors depending on the certification level. These motors generate incredible thrust, so we have to ensure our rocket is structurally strong enough to handle it.”

2. Stability:
   - “Stability is all about ensuring that the rocket flies straight and doesn’t wobble or spin out of control. This involves careful calculations to position the Center of Gravity (CG) and Center of Pressure (CP) correctly. For stable flight, the CG – which is where the rocket’s mass is centered – should be in front of the CP, which is the point where aerodynamic forces are balanced.”
   - “To achieve this, we adjust the weight distribution, fin design, and sometimes even add ballast to keep our rockets stable, especially with larger motors.”

3. Safety:
   - “Safety is our top priority. Designing a rocket isn’t just about making it fly; it’s about making sure it can recover safely, too. We use recovery systems like parachutes to bring the rocket back down gently. In high-power rocketry, we often use dual-deployment systems, with a small drogue parachute at apogee (highest point) and a main parachute closer to the ground to control the descent.”

> Speaker Tip: Use visuals on each slide to show images of motor classes, CG and CP positions on a rocket diagram, and examples of recovery systems for a clear visual representation.

#### [Slide 3: Practical Engineering & Problem Solving in Rocketry]

> Speaker: “What’s great about rocketry is that it challenges us to solve complex engineering problems. Here are a few examples of the kinds of challenges we tackle when designing rockets.”

1. Weight vs. Thrust:
   - “We need enough thrust to lift the rocket, but adding powerful motors means adding weight for structural support. This balancing act between weight and thrust is a classic engineering problem. In rocketry, we look at ways to make the rocket strong without making it too heavy.”

2. Material Selection:
   - “For a rocket that needs to withstand high thrust, we often use fiberglass or carbon fiber for the body tube and fins. But these materials come at a higher cost and require specific construction techniques. Choosing the right materials involves balancing strength, weight, and cost.”

3. Recovery Design:
   - “Designing a recovery system sounds simple, but it’s not. We have to think about the size of the parachutes, the timing of their deployment, and even the weather conditions. One small mistake, like a tangled parachute line, can mean a rough landing, so testing our recovery systems on the ground is critical.”

> Speaker Tip: Relate these examples back to students' fields of study, if possible, by explaining how these design challenges apply to engineering, physics, materials science, or even project management.

#### [Slide 4: From Classroom to Real Launches]

> Speaker: “One of the best things about being part of the UAA Rocketry Club is that we take these engineering principles from theory to real-world practice. In the classroom, you might study forces, materials, or electronics, but rocketry is where you get to apply it all.”

1. Applied Physics: 
   - “In rocketry, you get to see physics in action – the forces of thrust and drag, the stability of flight, and how gravity affects recovery. You can feel the impact of calculations when the rocket performs exactly as planned.”

2. Engineering and Project Management: 
   - “Building rockets requires collaboration and careful planning. We need to assign roles, set deadlines, test designs, and work together. These are essential skills for any project in engineering or science.”

3. Learning from Experience:
   - “With each launch, we get to see what worked and what didn’t, and this is where the real learning happens. If something doesn’t go as expected, we troubleshoot, make adjustments, and try again. Rocketry teaches resilience and adaptability.”

> Speaker Tip: Connect the practical aspects of rocketry to the students' potential career paths, highlighting how these skills translate to real-world jobs.
