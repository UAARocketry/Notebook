### Talk 1: “Intro to High-Power Rocketry: What You Can Achieve with Rocketry at UAA”

Objective: Introduce students to high-power rocketry and the exciting possibilities of the UAA Rocketry Club.

Outline:

1. Slide 1: Welcome & Introduction
   - Briefly introduce yourself and the UAA Rocketry Club.
   - Share a personal or team story about why rocketry is exciting.
   
2. Slide 2: What Is High-Power Rocketry?
   - Explain the difference between model rocketry and high-power rocketry.
   - Highlight the thrill of launching rockets that reach thousands of feet, with a focus on the certification journey from Level 1 to Level 3.

3. Slide 3: The Power of Certification
   - Overview of NAR and TRA certification levels and what they mean in terms of experience and skills.
   - Share how students can start with no experience and work their way up to launching rockets capable of reaching altitudes over 10,000 feet.
   
4. Slide 4: Why Join the UAA Rocketry Club?
   - Discuss the hands-on experience gained, from designing and building to testing and launching.
   - Emphasize how rocketry combines physics, engineering, creativity, and teamwork.

5. Slide 5: Upcoming Program and How to Get Involved
   - Share the Spring 2025 certification program, mentioning Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 builds (without emphasizing prerequisites).
   - Mention upcoming info sessions and how to sign up (QR code or link).

6. Q&A and Wrap-Up
   - Open the floor for questions.
   - Encourage students to add their names to a sign-up sheet or scan a QR code to stay updated.

### Talk 2: “The Science of Rocket Design: Balancing Power, Stability, and Safety”

Objective: Introduce basic rocket design concepts and show how rocketry builds practical STEM skills.

Outline:

1. Slide 1: Introduction
   - Briefly welcome attendees and recap the UAA Rocketry Club’s goal: building and launching high-power rockets.

2. Slide 2: The Three Key Elements of Rocket Design
   - Power: Overview of rocket engines (solid fuel), the impact of different motor classes (e.g., H, J, and M), and how power levels affect altitude.
   - Stability: Explain the importance of the rocket’s Center of Gravity (CG) and Center of Pressure (CP) for stable flight.
   - Safety: Emphasize the importance of designing rockets with a focus on controlled recovery (e.g., parachutes, dual-deployment systems).

3. Slide 3: Practical Engineering & Problem Solving in Rocketry
   - Examples of common design challenges: balancing weight, optimizing materials, and selecting the right recovery system.
   - How these challenges teach hands-on skills in aerodynamics, materials science, and project management.

4. Slide 4: From Classroom to Real Launches
   - Connect rocketry skills to broader STEM fields (aerospace, mechanical engineering, physics).
   - Share how team members apply academic knowledge in real-world settings with rockets that they design and launch themselves.

5. Slide 5: Join the Rocket Design Team
   - Explain that no experience is required; anyone with a passion for learning can join.
   - Share details of upcoming hands-on workshops and project roles in Spring 2025.

6. Q&A and Wrap-Up
   - Open the floor for questions and encourage those interested to join the sign-up sheet or QR code link for updates.

### Talk 3: “Launch Day: What It Takes to Prepare and Execute a Successful Rocket Launch”

Objective: Share the excitement of launch day and walk students through the launch preparation process.

Outline:

1. Slide 1: Introduction
   - Welcome students, highlighting that launch day is the culmination of weeks of hard work and preparation.

2. Slide 2: Launch Site Preparation
   - Brief overview of what goes into finding and preparing a launch site.
   - Mention partnerships with the local rocketry club to access safe, certified launch areas.

3. Slide 3: Pre-Launch Checks and Safety Protocols
   - Share the importance of ground testing, stability checks, and ejection charge setup.
   - Explain how launch teams conduct checklists to verify safety and functionality of electronics and recovery systems.

4. Slide 4: Countdown to Lift-Off
   - Walk students through the countdown and final preparations leading to launch.
   - Explain roles in the launch team (e.g., launch controller, safety officer, recovery team) and how each person contributes to a successful launch.

5. Slide 5: Recovery and Data Collection
   - Explain the recovery process and how team members locate and retrieve rockets, assess flight performance, and gather data.
   - Mention how data from launches help the team refine future designs, making each rocket better than the last.

6. Slide 6: Be Part of Our Next Launch Day
   - Invite students to experience a real launch day and sign up for updates on upcoming events and info sessions.

7. Q&A and Wrap-Up
   - Take questions and encourage students to connect with club members for more information.
