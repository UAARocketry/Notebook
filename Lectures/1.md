### Talk 1: Intro to High-Power Rocketry: What You Can Achieve with Rocketry at UAA

Objective: Introduce students to the UAA Rocketry Club, high-power rocketry certifications, and the opportunities available in the upcoming certification program. 

Length: ~15-20 minutes

#### [Slide 1: Welcome & Introduction]

> Speaker: “Hey everyone! Thanks for joining us today. My name is [Your Name], and I’m part of the UAA Rocketry Club. We’re a group of students who love pushing boundaries, tackling technical challenges, and, of course, building rockets! I want to give you a quick look at what high-power rocketry is all about, what our club does, and the awesome things we’re planning for next semester.”

> Speaker Tip: Share a brief personal anecdote about your interest in rocketry or a memorable club experience. This adds a personal touch and helps engage the audience.

#### [Slide 2: What Is High-Power Rocketry?]

> Speaker: “So, what is high-power rocketry? You might be familiar with small model rockets – the ones that launch with small engines and can be bought from hobby stores. High-power rocketry takes that to another level. We’re talking about rockets that can fly thousands of feet in the air, reaching speeds that require precise design, powerful motors, and solid teamwork to handle.”

> “High-power rocketry is a step up because we deal with much larger motors and more powerful engines. The rockets we build are certified by the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA). These certifications let us use specific motors and allow us to launch rockets that are a lot more powerful than what you’d typically see with hobby rockets.”

> “Our goal here at UAA Rocketry Club is to get certified in three levels. Each level lets us use bigger, more powerful motors and tackle more ambitious designs. That’s what makes it exciting!”

#### [Slide 3: The Power of Certification]

> Speaker: “The certification levels are essentially the backbone of high-power rocketry. Think of them like a license. Each level allows you to work with increasingly powerful rockets. We start with Level 1, which lets us use H and I motors – rockets that can fly up to around 3,000 feet. Then, Level 2 moves up to J and K motors, pushing rockets to even higher altitudes with more complex recovery systems. Finally, Level 3 certification, which is the pinnacle, allows us to work with motors powerful enough to take rockets past 10,000 feet.”

> “Next semester, our club is embarking on a certification journey. We’re building and launching three rockets, each one designed to achieve one of these certification levels. For us, it’s about learning through doing and gaining experience in rocketry’s technical and operational aspects.”

> Speaker Tip: Mention that achieving each certification level requires teamwork, precision, and a strong commitment to safety, subtly hinting at the type of responsibility that leadership-oriented students might find appealing.

#### [Slide 4: Why Join the UAA Rocketry Club?]

> Speaker: “Now you might be thinking, ‘Why join the UAA Rocketry Club?’ Well, if you’re interested in STEM, rocketry offers one of the most hands-on, practical experiences you can find on campus. You’ll have the chance to design, build, and launch real rockets, not just on a screen or in a textbook.”

> “Rocketry combines so many fields – physics, engineering, problem-solving, and creativity. It’s not just about technical work; it’s about brainstorming, designing, testing, and refining. We work together to make sure every rocket we launch is safe, stable, and ready for the sky.”

> Speaker Tip: Emphasize that students from all majors are welcome. Rocketeers need diverse skills, including design, writing, math, and logistics, making it clear that you’re looking for various talents.

#### [Slide 5: Upcoming Program and How to Get Involved]

> Speaker: “So, what’s coming up next semester? We’re launching our Rocket Certification Program! Starting in February, we’ll be designing, building, and testing rockets for Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 certifications. It’s going to be an amazing learning experience, and we’re looking for students who want to jump in and be part of this journey.”

> “If you’re interested in being part of the UAA Rocketry Club, we’re hosting a few info sessions and mini-events before the semester starts. We’d love for you to join us, learn more about rocketry, and even get hands-on with some of our components. Just scan this QR code or visit our [website/social media handle] to sign up for updates and info on upcoming events.”

#### [Q&A and Wrap-Up]

> Speaker: “Thank you all for being here today! I hope this gave you a glimpse into the exciting world of high-power rocketry and the incredible opportunities we have at UAA Rocketry Club. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. And if you’re interested, don’t forget to scan the QR code or sign up for updates. We’d love to have you join us!”

> Speaker Tip: Keep the Q&A open and informal. Encourage questions about the certification program, rocket design, or how to join. Be prepared for questions about time commitment and the technical aspects of the club’s activities.

### Visuals and Supplementary Materials

- Slide Visuals: Use images of rockets at different certification levels, flight trajectories, and components (motors, recovery systems). If possible, include photos from past launches or projects.
- Demo Rocket Component: If you have a small or old rocket component (nose cone, motor mount), bring it along for a physical demonstration.
- Flyers with QR Code: Hand out a flyer with the club’s QR code, linking to a sign-up form or interest page.
- Interest Signup Sheet: If possible, bring a sign-up sheet for students who prefer to leave their contact information directly.
