### Bill of Materials (BOM)

1. Body Tube: 
   - 2.6-inch (66 mm) diameter, reinforced phenolic or fiberglass
   - Length: 30–40 inches
   - Purpose: Main body, housing motor mount, and recovery system
   
2. Nose Cone:
   - Plastic nose cone (2.6-inch diameter, rounded or conical shape)
   - Length: ~8 inches
   - Provides aerodynamic stability and attachment for the shock cord

3. Motor Mount Kit:
   - Motor tube: 29mm or 38mm diameter (depending on motor size)
   - Centering rings (2.6-inch to 29/38mm adapter)
   - Motor retainer or clip (holds motor securely in place)

4. Fins:
   - Material: 1/8-inch plywood or fiberglass (for increased strength)
   - Shape: Low-profile trapezoidal for stability
   - Quantity: 3 or 4 fins, depending on the design

5. Recovery System:
   - Parachute: 24–36 inches (nylon or ripstop)
   - Shock cord: 9–12 feet (Kevlar or elastic)
   - Quick links or swivels: 2 for connecting shock cord and parachute
   - Eyebolt and washer: For attaching shock cord to bulkheads or centering rings

6. Electronics (Optional):
   - Altimeter (optional for motor ejection backup or if altitude tracking is desired)
   - Battery (for altimeter, usually 9V or lithium coin cell if needed)

7. Adhesives:
   - Epoxy (high-strength for bonding motor mount, fins, and fillets)
   - Cyanoacrylate (CA) glue (for tacking smaller components)

8. Miscellaneous:
   - Sandpaper (grit levels 100, 220, and 400)
   - Primer and paint (for finishing)
   - Masking tape (for motor friction fitting and alignment)

### Technical Specifications

- Length: ~48 inches
- Diameter: 2.6 inches
- Weight (without motor): ~1.5 kg (3.3 lbs)
- Motor Range: H123 to I161 (for Level 1 certification)
- Recovery: Single parachute, motor ejection or optional altimeter for deployment
- Estimated Altitude: 1,500–3,000 feet
- Center of Pressure (CP): Calculated based on fin placement, ideally 1–2 calibers below the center of gravity (CG)
- Center of Gravity (CG): Adjustable with motor and ballast as needed for stability

### Build Process

#### 1. Motor Mount Assembly
   - Step 1: Sand the motor tube and apply epoxy on the inside.
   - Step 2: Insert centering rings (front and back), ensuring a snug fit to the motor tube. Epoxy both in place and add internal fillets for extra strength.
   - Step 3: Attach a motor retainer to the end of the motor tube if needed.
   - Step 4: Set aside the motor mount to cure.

#### 2. Body Tube Preparation
   - Step 1: Mark the fin locations on the body tube, typically 120 degrees apart for three fins.
   - Step 2: Roughen the fin attachment areas with sandpaper to ensure a good bond.
   - Step 3: Install the motor mount inside the body tube using epoxy, ensuring it is centered and flush with the end. Epoxy both centering rings to the body tube.

#### 3. Fin Attachment
   - Step 1: Apply epoxy to one side of a fin and attach it to the marked line on the body tube.
   - Step 2: Hold or clamp the fin until the epoxy sets. Repeat for all fins.
   - Step 3: Once all fins are attached, add external fillets for strength and aerodynamic smoothness.

#### 4. Nose Cone Attachment
   - Step 1: Attach an eyebolt to the base of the nose cone with epoxy or install a bulkhead if needed.
   - Step 2: Attach the shock cord to the eyebolt with a quick link or knot.

#### 5. Recovery System Installation
   - Step 1: Attach the other end of the shock cord to the motor mount or bulkhead inside the body tube.
   - Step 2: Fold and pack the parachute, connecting it to the shock cord with a swivel.
   - Step 3: Ensure that the parachute fits comfortably inside the body tube but will deploy smoothly.

#### 6. Finishing and Painting
   - Step 1: Sand the entire rocket body and fins to smooth out epoxy fillets and joints.
   - Step 2: Apply a primer coat, then sand again with 400-grit sandpaper.
   - Step 3: Apply 2–3 layers of paint, allowing each coat to dry fully before applying the next.
   - Step 4: Optionally, add a clear coat for a glossy finish.

#### 7. Final Assembly and Flight Prep
   - Step 1: Insert the motor into the motor mount, securing it with a motor retainer or friction fitting.
   - Step 2: Ensure that the rocket’s CG is ahead of the CP by at least one caliber for stable flight.
   - Step 3: Conduct a ground test to check ejection charge function and recovery system deployment.
   - Step 4: At the launch site, insert a suitable motor, arm any electronics, and conduct a safety check.

### Flight Checklist

1. Pre-Flight: Check parachute packing, motor retention, and CG location.
2. Launch Approval: Follow launch range safety protocols and ensure all observers are at a safe distance.
3. Launch and Recovery: Monitor flight path and retrieve the rocket after landing. Ensure the rocket is in a condition suitable for reflight.
