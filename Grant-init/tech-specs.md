### Level 1 Certification Rocket
Rocket Name: Apogee Zephyr

- Motor Impulse Class: H or I (e.g., Aerotech H123 or I161)
- Length: 48 inches (122 cm)
- Diameter: 2.6 inches (66 mm)
- Weight (without motor): ~1.6 kg (3.5 lbs)
- Recovery System: Single parachute, deployed by motor ejection or electronic deployment
- Construction Materials: Reinforced phenolic body tube, plastic nose cone, plywood fins
- Altitude Potential: 1,500–3,000 feet (depending on motor selection)
- Notes: Ideal for first-time high-power flyers, easy to assemble, and stable with basic design. The motor ejection system can be used for deployment, reducing complexity.

### Level 2 Certification Rocket
Rocket Name: Madcow Rocketry Frenzy XL

- Motor Impulse Class: J or K (e.g., Aerotech J350 or K550)
- Length: 78 inches (198 cm)
- Diameter: 4 inches (102 mm)
- Weight (without motor): ~4.5 kg (10 lbs)
- Recovery System: Dual-deployment with electronics bay; drogue and main parachute
- Construction Materials: Fiberglass body tube, G10 fiberglass fins, fiberglass nose cone
- Altitude Potential: 4,000–6,000 feet (depending on motor selection)
- Electronics: Altimeter (e.g., RRC3 from Missile Works) for dual-deployment capability
- Notes: The dual-deployment system allows safer recovery from higher altitudes, reducing drift. The strong fiberglass structure and electronics bay make it a robust choice for the higher impulse motors of Level 2.

### Level 3 Certification Rocket
Rocket Name: Wildman Extreme Darkstar 4-inch

- Motor Impulse Class: M or N (e.g., CTI M1297 or N3300)
- Length: 108 inches (274 cm)
- Diameter: 6 inches (152 mm)
- Weight (without motor): ~10 kg (22 lbs)
- Recovery System: Dual-redundant deployment with dual altimeters and separate battery systems; drogue and main parachutes
- Construction Materials: Carbon fiber body tube, CNC-machined aluminum avionics bay, carbon fiber fins
- Altitude Potential: 12,000–25,000 feet (depending on motor and design modifications)
- Electronics: Dual altimeters (e.g., Altus Metrum TeleMega, Featherweight GPS for telemetry tracking)
- Redundancy: Two independent ejection charges for main and drogue chutes; backup electronics for added safety
- Notes: Built to withstand high-stress flights at supersonic speeds with durable materials and advanced recovery systems. The project must be meticulously planned, with detailed documentation of the design and construction to meet certification board requirements.
