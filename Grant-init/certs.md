High Power Rocketry (HPR) certifications are structured into three progressive levels, each permitting the use of increasingly powerful motors and more complex rocket designs. The National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA) are the primary organizations overseeing these certifications in the United States.

Must be a member in good standing of the NAR or TRA.

### Level 1 (L1) Certification:
Allows the purchase and use of H and I impulse class motors. Certain F and G motors may also require Level 1 certification for purchase and use. 

#### Certification Process:
  - Construct and successfully fly a rocket using at least one H or I impulse motor.
  - The flight must be observed by a certification team comprising at least one certified individual at or above the certification level being attempted.
  - The rocket must be recovered in a condition suitable for reflight.

### Level 2 (L2) Certification:
Must hold a valid Level 1 certification.
Permits the use of J, K, and L impulse class motors. 

#### Certification Process:
  - Pass a written examination demonstrating knowledge of high-power rocketry safety codes, regulations, and technical aspects.
  - Construct and successfully fly a rocket using at least one J, K, or L impulse motor.
  - The flight must be observed by a certification team comprising at least one certified individual at or above the certification level being attempted.
  - The rocket must be recovered in a condition suitable for reflight.

### Level 3 (L3) Certification:
Must hold a valid Level 2 certification.
Allows the use of M, N, and O impulse class motors. 

#### Certification Process:
  - Develop a detailed project plan, including design, materials, and construction methods, to be reviewed and approved by a certification committee (NAR's Level 3 Certification Committee or TRA's Technical Advisory Panel).
  - Construct the rocket according to the approved plan, incorporating redundant electronic recovery systems.
  - Conduct a successful flight using an M, N, or O impulse motor, observed by the certification committee members.
  - Recover the rocket in a condition suitable for reflight.
