   - Quantity: 3 or 4 fins, attached with strong internal and external fillets

5. Recovery System:
   - Drogue Parachute: 24–36 inches for initial high-speed descent
   - Main Parachute: 96–120 inches for final descent
   - Shock Cord: 40–60 feet (Kevlar or tubular nylon, for both main and drogue)
   - Quick Links and Swivels: Heavy-duty steel or titanium, rated for high loads
   - Eyebolts/U-bolts: For shock cord attachment in airframe sections

6. Electronics Bay (Avionics Bay):
   - Removable electronics sled with mounting points
   - Altimeters: Two independent altimeters for redundancy (e.g., Altus Metrum TeleMega and Featherweight GPS)
   - Battery: Two sets of 9V or lithium-ion batteries, each on independent circuits
   - Switches: External arming switches for each altimeter, lockable for safety
   - Telemetry and Tracking: Optional GPS tracker for real-time positioning

7. Redundant Deployment Hardware:
   - Dual ejection charges per altimeter for both drogue and main chutes (primary and backup charges)
   - Igniters for ejection charges (e.g., low-current e-match igniters)

8. Adhesives and Fillers:
   - High-strength epoxy (e.g., West System or Rocketpoxy for fin and motor mount bonding)
   - Filleting epoxy for added reinforcement on fins and structural joints

9. Miscellaneous:
   - Sandpaper (grit levels 100, 220, 400 for surface prep)
   - Primer and paint (for finishing and aesthetics)
   - Masking tape for alignment and temporary attachment

### Build Process

#### 1. Motor Mount Assembly
   - Step 1: Sand the motor tube and apply epoxy to both ends.
   - Step 2: Place centering rings at both ends of the motor tube and add internal fillets.
   - Step 3: Install a threaded motor retainer at the end to secure larger M or N motors.
   - Step 4: Leave to cure, ensuring alignment and strength.

#### 2. Body Tube Preparation and Assembly
   - Step 1: Mark fin alignment lines on the body tube, spaced evenly for stability.
   - Step 2: Roughen up the fin attachment areas to improve the epoxy bond.
   - Step 3: Install the motor mount inside the airframe body tube, ensuring it sits centered with the centering rings flush against the tube walls.

#### 3. Fin Attachment
   - Step 1: Using high-strength epoxy, attach fins one by one along the alignment marks on the airframe.
   - Step 2: Apply internal and external fillets to each fin attachment point, letting each layer cure before the next.
   - Step 3: Sand and smooth fillets to minimize drag and improve airflow.

#### 4. Electronics Bay (Avionics Bay) Construction
   - Step 1: Assemble the electronics sled with altimeters, batteries, and wiring connections.
   - Step 2: Ensure each altimeter has an independent power source and switch for redundancy.
   - Step 3: Secure the sled within the electronics bay, with wiring for both drogue and main ejection charges.
   - Step 4: Test ejection charge wiring and continuity before final assembly.

#### 5. Nose Cone and Recovery System
   - Step 1: Attach an eyebolt or U-bolt to the nose cone with epoxy for a secure connection.
   - Step 2: Connect the shock cord from the electronics bay to the nose cone, attaching the main parachute to the shock cord with a swivel to prevent twisting.
   - Step 3: Pack the drogue and main parachutes in their respective sections, securing them to avoid tangling.

#### 6. Dual-Deployment Recovery System Setup
   - Step 1: Attach drogue parachute to electronics bay, positioned for high-altitude deployment.
   - Step 2: Configure altimeters to deploy the drogue at apogee and the main at a lower altitude (e.g., 800 feet).
   - Step 3: Add redundant charges for both drogue and main deployment for fail-safe recovery.

#### 7. Finishing and Painting
   - Step 1: Sand all surfaces smooth and apply primer.
   - Step 2: Apply multiple coats of paint and optionally a clear coat for durability.
   - Step 3: Inspect all components for a polished, professional finish.

#### 8. Final Assembly and Flight Prep
   - Step 1: Insert the selected M or N motor, securing it with the motor retainer.
   - Step 2: Arm the electronics via external switches and confirm continuity for both ejection charges.
   - Step 3: Perform a full ground test to verify deployment systems and altimeter settings.
   - Step 4: Confirm the rocket’s CG and CP for stability, adding ballast if necessary.
