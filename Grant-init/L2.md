### Bill of Materials (BOM)

1. Body Tube: 
   - 4-inch (102 mm) diameter, reinforced phenolic or fiberglass
   - Length: 48–60 inches
   - Provides a larger, more durable main body to house the motor mount, recovery system, and electronics bay

2. Nose Cone:
   - Fiberglass or plastic nose cone (4-inch diameter, rounded or ogive shape)
   - Length: ~12–15 inches
   - Attachment point for shock cord and altimeter compartment if necessary

3. Motor Mount Kit:
   - Motor tube: 54mm diameter (for J or K class motors)
   - Centering rings (4-inch to 54mm adapter)
   - Motor retainer (threaded or Aeropack retainer for secure motor fitting)

4. Fins:
   - Material: 1/4-inch fiberglass or G10 composite
   - Shape: Swept trapezoidal for improved stability and aerodynamics
   - Quantity: 3 or 4 fins, depending on design

5. Recovery System:
   - Drogue parachute: 18–24 inches for high-speed descent
   - Main parachute: 48–60 inches for low-speed descent
   - Shock cord: 20–25 feet of Kevlar or tubular nylon
   - Quick links or swivels: 2 for attaching components
   - Eyebolt and washer: For securing shock cords to bulkheads and centering rings

6. Electronics Bay:
   - Electronics sled with mounting hardware
   - Altimeter(s): Two (primary and backup) for dual-deployment (e.g., RRC3 or PerfectFlite StratoLogger)
   - Battery: Two 9V or 3.7V lithium-ion batteries for redundancy
   - Switches: Arm/disarm switch or rotary switch for each altimeter

7. Adhesives:
   - Epoxy (high-strength for bonding motor mount, fins, and electronics bay)
   - Filleting epoxy for additional reinforcement

8. Miscellaneous:
   - Sandpaper (grit levels 100, 220, and 400)
   - Primer and paint (for finishing)
   - Masking tape (for motor fitting and alignment)

### Build Process

#### 1. Motor Mount Assembly
   - Step 1: Sand the motor tube and apply epoxy on the inside for center rings.
   - Step 2: Place centering rings at both ends of the motor tube, with one at the end and one slightly inward, adding epoxy for reinforcement.
   - Step 3: Install a motor retainer at the end of the motor tube for secure motor placement.
   - Step 4: Set aside the motor mount to cure.

#### 2. Body Tube Preparation
   - Step 1: Mark fin attachment lines on the body tube, typically at 120-degree intervals for three fins.
   - Step 2: Roughen the marked areas with sandpaper for better adhesion.
   - Step 3: Install the motor mount assembly inside the body tube using epoxy, ensuring that the centering rings are flush and properly aligned.

#### 3. Fin Attachment
   - Step 1: Apply epoxy to the root edge of each fin and attach it along the marked lines on the body tube.
   - Step 2: Hold or clamp each fin until the epoxy sets, then apply epoxy fillets along each fin joint for added strength.
   - Step 3: Sand and smooth the fillets after curing to improve aerodynamics.

#### 4. Electronics Bay (E-bay) Construction
   - Step 1: Assemble the electronics sled and mount altimeters securely, along with batteries and switches for arming.
   - Step 2: Securely attach the electronics sled within the electronics bay and connect wiring to allow deployment signals for both drogue and main chutes.
   - Step 3: Add an external switch access point for easy arming at the launch site.

#### 5. Nose Cone Attachment
   - Step 1: Attach an eyebolt to the base of the nose cone, epoxying it securely.
   - Step 2: Connect a shock cord to the eyebolt with a quick link or knot to secure the recovery system.

#### 6. Dual-Deployment Recovery System Installation
   - Step 1: Attach the drogue parachute to the electronics bay and the main parachute to the nose cone, using swivels to avoid twisting.
   - Step 2: Install quick links for easy detachment and reattachment, ensuring each parachute is packed correctly within the designated sections.
   - Step 3: Route shock cords to avoid tangling and allow for full deployment without snagging.

#### 7. Finishing and Painting
   - Step 1: Sand the entire rocket body and fins smooth for a clean finish.
   - Step 2: Apply primer and sand again with 400-grit sandpaper.
   - Step 3: Apply 2–3 coats of paint, letting each layer dry completely, followed by an optional clear coat.

#### 8. Final Assembly and Flight Prep
   - Step 1: Insert a suitable J or K motor into the motor mount, securing it with the motor retainer.
   - Step 2: Arm the electronics via switches and verify altimeter connections.
   - Step 3: Perform a ground test to confirm the functionality of the recovery system and deployment charges.
   - Step 4: Check CG and CP to confirm stability, adding ballast as needed.

### Flight Checklist

1. Pre-Flight: Verify all electronics are operational, parachutes are packed, and altimeters are configured correctly for dual deployment.
2. Launch Approval: Ensure compliance with range safety protocols and follow launch officer instructions.
3. Launch and Recovery: Observe rocket trajectory and parachute deployments for a safe recovery. Inspect the rocket for reusability.
