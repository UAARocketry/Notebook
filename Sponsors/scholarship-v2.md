### Selection Process

1. **Eligibility and Academic Flexibility**  
   - There is no minimum GPA required for application. However, if an applicant’s GPA is below 2.5, they must submit a written explanation detailing challenges they faced, what they learned, and how they plan to succeed academically in the coming semesters.

2. **Project-Based Application Requirements**  
   - **Technical Project Submission**: Each applicant must submit a technical project relevant to the research and technical objectives of the UAA Rocketry Team. Projects may vary widely and can include designs, simulations, or prototypes in fields related to rocketry or adjacent areas with applicable skills.
   - **Explanation of Relevance**: Applicants must provide a written description of how their project relates to aerospace or contributes to the club’s goals. They should articulate the skills demonstrated and explain the project’s potential application within the UAA Rocketry Club.

3. **Project Categories and Examples**  
   Below are categories with example projects to guide applicants in understanding the types of submissions encouraged:

   - **Rocket Design and Fabrication**
     - Example Projects: 
       - A thrust vector control (TVC) mount designed to stabilize flight trajectory.
       - Full rocket designs, including structural analysis and material selection.
       - Simulation models for structural integrity under varying loads.
   
   - **Control Algorithms and Simulation Software**
     - Example Projects: 
       - Custom flight control algorithms for stability, recovery, or navigation.
       - Software that simulates launch and recovery phases for high-altitude rockets.
