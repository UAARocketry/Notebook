### Promotional Tactics

#### 1. “Rocketry Teaser” Posters and Flyers ($25)
   - Design: Create visually striking posters with a simple, bold tagline like, “Ready for Lift-Off?” or “Join UAA’s Next Big Launch.” Include a QR code leading to a quick Google Form or interest list signup.
   - Distribution: Place posters in high-traffic areas, particularly around engineering, physics, computer science, and campus common areas.

#### 2. “Rocket Science on Campus” Mini Talk Series ($0)
   - Goal: Host two or three informal mini-talks in common campus areas like the library or student center. Topics can include “Intro to High-Power Rocketry” or “The Basics of Rocket Design.”
   - Format: Keep it casual (15-20 minutes) and allow curious students to join, learn, and ask questions. End each talk with a quick mention of upcoming activities in the Rocketry Club and hand out flyers.
   - Location: Partner with faculty or the student center for a designated space on campus.

#### 3. Social Media Countdown Campaign ($0)
   - Platform: Instagram, Twitter, and campus community pages.
   - Content: Launch a 2-month countdown to the start of the program, with bi-weekly posts like “60 days until launch…,” “Building rockets isn’t just for engineers,” and “UAA Rocketry: Are you ready?”
   - Call to Action: Include an interest list link and encourage followers to share the posts to reach more students.

#### 4. Peer Word-of-Mouth ($0)
   - Tactic: Leverage club members to talk to peers, attend club fairs, and promote the Rocketry Club in classes or study groups.
   - Message: Encourage members to mention the upcoming certification program and invite potential recruits with interests in project management, hands-on building, or technical problem-solving.
   
#### 5. Club Info Session (Mid-December) ($0)
   - Event: Host an informal, end-of-semester info session in mid-December. This session will be a chance to meet members, hear about the upcoming project, and understand the opportunities in the club.
   - Incentives: Offer light snacks or simple giveaways (if budget allows), and use the opportunity to build a mailing list.

#### 6. Interest Capture and Follow-Up  
   - Google Form: Capture student details through a quick online interest form linked on posters and social media posts.
   - Follow-Up Email: In early January, send an email to everyone who signed up, introducing the program, sharing semester goals, and announcing the official spring kick-off event.
