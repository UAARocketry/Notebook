## Rocketry UAA

Phase 1 | Fundimentals & Saftey
- Design, test, and launch static rockets to acheive L1-L3 certs
- get up to 1,500
- 3d printed, cardboard tubes, basic fins/body. stock supplies
rocket names:
L1 - HA
L2 - LOL
L3 - LMAO

Phase 2 | Home Brew
- Design a system that can alter its vector of travel via direct manipulation of control surfaces
    - Fin control systems
- 3 in diameter
- ~O + motor
- Basic telemetry system
    - Down/Up link (probably 2.4gHz or 915mHz)
    - accelorometer
    - barometer
    - GPS
    - mission control software
    - ? camera
    - ~5hz update rate
    - digital protocol (likley navlink or similar)
    - ground station w/ launch controls
        - GPS
        - web  app/ server
        - launch pad 
        - saftey sensors
- monthly launch intervals, shift focus on lab/static tests
- Space Shot
- develop SOP
- multi staged
rocket names:
MISF (Missile Inspired Space Flight)
WEEE (idk, i just think itd be funny)

Phase 3 | Research & Development
- Thrust vector control
- Advanced telemetry
- Motor design
    - Alternative mixtures for solid fuel
    - Liquid
- Continual with periodic repotition of phase 1/2 projects for new members
- Documentation for internal use 
- Develop / contribute to OSS solutions for rocketry
- Refine processes



Teams:
- Motor
    - procurment
    - formulation
    - testing / qa 
    - safe handling / transport / storage
- Body
    - structure
    - airodynamics
    - static stability
- Control
    - c2 (command and control)
    - ground systems
    - telemetry 
    - cordination
    - avionics
- Admin (team effort for now)
    - make sure everything is cordinated with FAA that needs to be
    - financials/funding
    - saftey

Funding:
- model rocket kits for kids
- launch day
- merch
- grants
- sponsorships

- hackathon - also for awarness / recruitment



Mission:
"To advance our understanding of rocket and aviation technologies in the State of Alaska."
