### **Manufacturing Procedures**

#### **1. Combustion Chamber**
1. **Material Preparation**:
   - Cut a copper alloy cylinder to the required dimensions (length: 1,380 mm; diameter: 138 mm).  
   - Wall thickness: 4 mm.  

2. **Cooling Channel Machining**:
   - Use a CNC lathe to machine **spiral cooling channels** (2–3 mm deep, 2–3 mm wide) on the outer surface.  
   - Ensure uniform spacing for optimal heat transfer.  

3. **Attach Cooling Jacket**:
   - Wrap a stainless steel sheet around the chamber to enclose the channels.  
   - Braze or TIG-weld the jacket to the chamber, ensuring airtight sealing.  

4. **Throat Attachment**:
   - Machine the throat section (46 mm diameter) from Inconel or Graphite.  
   - TIG weld the throat to the chamber’s converging section.  

5. **Heat Treatment**:
   - Perform a stress-relief annealing process in a furnace to avoid cracking during operation.

#### **2. Nozzle**
1. **Material Preparation**:
   - Cut a stainless steel cone for the nozzle, with:
     - **Throat Diameter**: 46 mm
     - **Exit Diameter**: 145.2 mm
     - **Length**: 230 mm  

2. **Nozzle Machining**:
   - Machine the nozzle’s internal profile (30° converging, 15° diverging angles) using a CNC lathe.  
   - Polish the inner surface to minimize flow separation.

3. **Throat Integration**:
   - Insert the pre-machined graphite/Inconel throat into the nozzle.  
   - Secure with high-temperature adhesives or mechanical locking.

4. **Surface Coating**:
   - Apply a ceramic thermal barrier coating to the nozzle to protect against thermal erosion.

---

#### **3. Injector Plate**
1. **Material Preparation**:
   - Cut a stainless steel plate (10 mm thick) to fit the chamber diameter.  

2. **Injector Hole Drilling**:
   - Use a CNC mill to drill precision holes for oxidizer and fuel jets (O/F = 2.2).  
   - Typical design: **Showerhead or Pintle Injector**.  
     - 2/3 holes for LOX, 1/3 for IPA.  

3. **Surface Finishing**:
   - Use a surface grinder to ensure a flat sealing surface.  

4. **Assembly Preparation**:
   - Drill bolt holes around the edge to secure the plate to the chamber.  

---

#### **4. Assembly**
1. **Dry Fit**:
   - Assemble the chamber, nozzle, and injector to ensure proper alignment.  

2. **Welding and Sealing**:
   - TIG weld chamber sections and nozzle.  
   - Install Viton gaskets or O-rings between the injector plate and chamber for a seal.  

3. **Feed Line Connection**:
   - Attach stainless steel tubing to the injector plate.  
   - Weld or thread connections securely.  

---

#### **5. Testing and Inspection**
1. **Pressure Test**:
   - Pressurize the chamber to 1.5× operating pressure (~450 psi) to check for leaks.  

2. **Flow Test**:
   - Verify proper fuel and oxidizer flow rates through the injector.  

3. **Hot Fire Test**:
   - Conduct a short-duration static test (1–3 seconds) to verify thrust and cooling.  
   - Inspect all components for thermal or mechanical damage post-test.
